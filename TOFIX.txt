ROUND 1
X error, allow handling of orig placenames as gcps
X error, output rmse
- error, output dev from orig placenames
X error, output percent of placenames detected
- RUN ON CURRENT RESULTS!

ROUND 2
- error, loop and create table of opts + error outputs
- MAKE SOME GRAPHS!

ROUND 3
- fix projections
- fix arealabel cropping
- rerun everything, n=2 (render, georef, error)
- COLLATE TABLE AND EXPLORE!

ROUND 4
- warp() doesnt work correctly for >1 order. probably due to incorrect matrix inversion during backwards sampling in rmse.predict() for >1 order. 
- georef, save transform matrix
- error, reuse transform matrix
